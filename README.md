Simple Raytracer
================

This is a simple raytracer with a few built-in scenes. I originally wrote it for a homework assignment, but later fixed some bugs and polished the code.

Running
-------

1. Open the solution file in Visual Studio 2015.
2. Build the solution.
3. Install `Raytracer\lib\glut32.dll` (either copy it to `C:\Windows\SysWOW64` or the current executable directory).
4. Launch the program.
5. Use keys 1-4 to select different scenes

You can view this in 3D by crossing your eyes and focusing on the blended image that appears in the middle.
